># ***Blog Description...***
>

post per week (preferably on sundays). However, I will try to write more depending on the availability of free time. Following are some of the primary and 
>secondary topics I will write about in this blog
>1. **Primary Topics** - OpenSees (Tcl and Python), Visual Studio (C++), Matlab, Finite Element Analysis and Mechanics of Reinforced Concrete. These are my core area of intersts, readers can expect more than 80% of posts in 
>these topics.
>2. **Secondary Topics** - Structural Analysis, Mathematics (esp. Calculus and Linear Algebra), Static Site Generators and some general topics such as Research Methodology,
>Personality development etc. 

A friend of mine writes short stories. One sunny day, I asked if he wanted a website to showcase his works and he agreed. I decided to use GitHub Pages to host his site. That way he wouldn't have to buy a domain and a server.

While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build **Tale**.
